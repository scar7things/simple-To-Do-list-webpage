Explanation

    Flask Application (app.py):
        The index route renders the main page and shows all tasks.
        The add route handles the addition of new tasks from the form submission.
        The delete route removes a task based on its index in the list.





        HTML Template (index.html):

    A simple HTML form is provided for adding new tasks.
    A list displays each task with a delete link next to it.
